# Module-5-Challenge

This is the complete version of my challenge! It was fun and I hope the code performs well!

## Directories

There are two folders, and three files

1. .ipynb_checkpoints  -- Contains Jupyter Notebooks checkpoints, not relevant 
2. data -- Contains the data for this challenge
  - Mouse_metadata.csv
  - Study_results.csv

3. Pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb -- The starter code I worked out of
4. .gitattributes
5. README.md -- What you see rightnow! ðŸ˜Ž
